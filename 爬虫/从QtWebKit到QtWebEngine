[WebKit](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/ProjectVision) is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE. As part of KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their porting efforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent. [QtWebKit](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit) is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back to Qt.

Removed Modules

With Qt 5.6 the following modules are no longer part of the release packages, but users can still build them from source:
